# About OpenOS

OpenOS is an operating system used to test _**public data sharing across multiple devices**_! This is done by using _**Pythons Requests system with GitHub's Gists**_, which are super useful! _**Apps refer to mini Python programs that OpenOS can run**_!

If you want an easier and smoother way to get OpenOS, in your Linux terminal, run:

````git clone httpsâ€‹://github.com/AnniePrograms/OpenOS.git````

And _**it's that simple!**_
