# About OpenOS

OpenOS is an operating system used to test _**public data sharing across multiple devices**_! This is done by using _**Pythons Requests system with GitHub's Gists**_, which are super useful! Nothing is available yet, but I'm working on it! OpenOS will have an app menu for selecting and opening apps using indexing! _**Apps refer to mini Python programs that OpenOS can run**_!
